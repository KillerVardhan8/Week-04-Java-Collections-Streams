## Overview

This week introduces and expands on vital Java programming tools and techniques that form the backbone of robust, efficient applications. The focus lies on type-safe programming with generics, effective data storage and manipulation using collections, handling input and output through streams, managing runtime errors, pattern matching with regular expressions, unit testing, and modern Java features introduced in Java 8.

---

## Day 1: Java Generics

- Understanding type parameters and generic classes/methods  
- Benefits of type safety and code reuse  
- Implementing generic interfaces and bounds  
- Using wildcards for flexible method parameters  
- Common use cases and pitfalls  

---

## Day 2: Collections

- Overview of Java Collection Framework interfaces and implementations  
- Differences between List, Set, and Map  
- Working with HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap  
- Sorting, searching, and iteration techniques  
- Using Collections utility methods  

---

## Day 3: Java IO Streams

- Reading and writing data using byte and character streams  
- Buffered streams for performance improvements  
- Object serialization and deserialization  
- Working with file input/output  
- Handling file-related exceptions  

---

## Day 4: Exceptions

- Checked vs unchecked exceptions  
- Creating custom exceptions  
- Exception handling best practices using try-catch-finally  
- Using try-with-resources for automatic resource management  
- Propagating exceptions and multi-catch blocks  

---

## Day 5: Regex & JUnit

- Writing and applying regular expressions for pattern matching  
- Common regex constructs and usage in Java  
- Unit testing fundamentals using JUnit framework  
- Writing test cases, assertions, and test lifecycle annotations  
- Parameterized tests and test suites  

---

## Day 6: Java 8 Features

- Introduction to Lambda expressions and functional interfaces  
- Stream API for data processing (filter, map, reduce)  
- Method references and default methods in interfaces  
- Optional class to handle nullability  
- Date and Time API enhancements  

---

## Prerequisites

- Core Java fundamentals  
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming  
- Basic understanding of exception handling  
- JDK 8 or higher installed  
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
